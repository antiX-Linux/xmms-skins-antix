=============================================


Installation
------------
The usual way. You should have received this file in a gzip'ed tar
archive named maXMMS.tar.gz. The archive contains a subdirectory
called maXMMS, so you can simply extract it into your XMMS skins
directory.


Comments
--------
This is my first skin for XMMS. I started experimenting with
Jesse Kaufman's NeXTAmp2 v1.0pre1 skin to make it match the colors
of Window Maker's dialog boxes better. I did not stop there and went
on changing and changing it. After a while I realized that working
on a bright skin in my dark room was not the way to go. :-)
I decided to create a dark(ish) skin instead, so I totally redraw it.
Here is the result.



Have fun!
